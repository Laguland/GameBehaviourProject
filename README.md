# MonoGame â€“ Game Behaviour
I have used MonoGame because I needed a clean game engine. I was not allowed to use any other physics or AI libraries than my own. It was a great experience that taught me about making games inside out. Project features:
  
 * A* pathfinding algorithm
 * Map loading system ready for randomly generated maps (random map generation system was not implemented because of lack of time)
 * AABB Collision detection
 * Simple physics forces, throw simulation
 * Polymorphic design
